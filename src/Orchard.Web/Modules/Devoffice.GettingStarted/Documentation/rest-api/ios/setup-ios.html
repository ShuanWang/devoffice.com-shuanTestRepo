<h3 id="get-setup">Get setup with iOS</h3>
<p>If you haven't already, let's get setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get Xcode</li>
<li>Install and setup <a href="http://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a> dependency manager by running the following commands:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
</code></pre>

<p>If the install and setup were successful, you should see the message <strong>Setup completed</strong> in Terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: These commands only needs to be run once.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you'd like, download the <a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-365-SDK-for-iOS">Office 365 SDK for iOS</a>, otherwise, we'll take care of this in a bit.</li>
